        <p style="margin-top: 5%;">These huge computers are used to solve very complex science and engineering problems. 
                Supercomputers get their processing power by taking advantage of parallel processing; 
                they use lots of CPUs at the same time on one problem. A typical supercomputer can 
                do up to ten trillion individual calculations every second. 
                A supercomputer is a computer with very high-level computational capacities compared 
                to a general-purpose computer such as a personal desktop or laptop.
Clearly this is a moving target – today’s laptop would have been a supercomputer only a couple of decades
 ago – but no matter how fast today’s general-purpose computers are, there will always be a need for much
  more powerful machines.
Supercomputers were first introduced in the 1960s by Seymour Roger Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), 
and have been used intensively in science and engineering ever since. To keep track of the state-of-the-art,
 the supercomputing community looks to the Top500 list, which ranks the fastest 500 supercomputers in the world
 every six months. We will look at this list in more detail in the next activity.
